Store logic that facilitates interaction with the underlying database.

==========
    close_connection: Close the DB API connection.

    This procedure does the following:
        - Creates all the tables bound to a metadata and their associated schema constructs.
        - Creates the database engine & loads it in the flask config, where it's held globally for
            the lifetime of the application.

    Notes
    =====
        - models.metadata is a container object that keeps together many features of a database.
        - The engine object created below is a mechanism that provides db connectivity and behavior.

    This procedure is safe to be called multiple times, as, by default, will not attempt to recreate
        tables that are already present in the target database. Rebooting the server during
        development or production won't affect the database.
